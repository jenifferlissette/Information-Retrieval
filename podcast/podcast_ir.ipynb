    "# Workshop: Building an Information Retrieval System for Podcast Episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "Create an Information Retrieval (IR) system that processes a dataset of podcast transcripts and, given a query, returns the episodes where the host and guest discuss the query topic. Use TF-IDF and BERT for vector space representation and compare the results."
